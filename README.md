Inspired by GoodGhosting's distributed deposits, the current app is an experiment in using longitudinal contract interactions to improve player memory and knowledge related to learning objectives.

The experiment is designed in 3 parts.

During the first, participants indicate their preference over a range of interdisciplinary learning outcomes, such as emotional regulation strategies, research question formulation for search optimization, or governance and legitimacy in crypto and usual politics. Only topics passing a staking threshold are turned into quizzes. For example, I am only going to educate myself on a subject if another X amount of people do the same. Otherwise, it would be pretty boring of me not to have anyone to juggle ideas about this with. I might also be seen as a weirdo for learning that. 

For fun, In the second phase, participants are assigned to two learning conditions, where quizzes have to be completed either sequentially (AAA, BBB, CCC) or alternatively (ABC, ABC, ABC).  It's hypothesized that the performance on the test in the alternative learning condition will be higher than the that of sequential [cite].

Winners of the second round can propose learning outcomes for the third. Smaller groups are randomly formed in the third round, to increase the level of relatedness between participants. After the final quizzes completed, participants receive NFTs that enable other users to replay the game at the according level.
